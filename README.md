# Deref's Go Utilities

Every project winds up with a dumping ground package of utility functions.
Occassionally, some assorted functions are so widely used that they get
promoted to a shared utilities dumping ground. This is that place for Deref's
Go utility functions.

Ideally, once functions have reached this repository, they are extremely widely
used and already stable. Until that is true, copy/paste is your friend.
